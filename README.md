# What you don't find here

- Does not include the codes to do the initial parsing and classification of the patents.
- Does not provide the codes of how to go from one dataset to the other.
- This is not a replication kit for our paper. So you won't find data and codes here to reproduce all the figures and tables in our paper.

# Datasets

All datasets cover the period 1976 to 2014 and the regional coverage are the United States. 

## 1. Patent level dataset

Includes all US utility patents and contains the information for every patent if we classify it as automation or not. To construct some variables (`cts`, `cts_wt` and `assignee`)

The assignee and citation data is from the [Fung Institute](https://github.com/funginstitute/downloads) and stops in 2010.

- `year`: Grant year.
- `week`: Identifies weekly files that patent was published in.
- `patent`: Patent number (7 characters)
- `automat`: Classification as automation patent after excluding patents.
- `raw_automat`: Classification as automation patent before excluding patents.
- `excl`: We exclude many chemical or pharmaceutical patents in our empirical analysis. See paper.
- `post_yes`: The posterior probability that a patent 
- `post_no`: The posterior probability that a patent 
- `hjt`: Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg top-level categories
- `hjt_name`: Hall-Jaffe-Trajtenberg subcategories by name
- `uspc_primary`: Every patent is assigned one or several USPC numbers. This reports the first such number that is written in the patent documents. This is not the number we use to match patents to industries, as we use IPC numbers for this and it requires an additional dataset of *all* of patents' IPC numbers. 
- `length_pattext`: Length of patent text as measured by the number of lines in [Google](https://www.google.com/googlebooks/uspto-patents-grants-text.html)'s text files. Number is missing for every last patent in the weekly files.
- `cts`: Number of citations using Fung Institute data.
- `cts_wt`: Number of weighted citations. See paper for explanation.
- `assignee`: The group of patent assignee ("US firm", "foreigners", "governments", "universities" or missing/"NA"). We use the Fung Institute data to identify US firms, foreigners and governments and our own coding to find universities. 


## 2. Industry level dataset

We distribute all patents probabilistically to industries where they are created ("sector of manufacture") and where they are likely to be used ("industry of use"). See paper and the links above for explanations.

- `year`: Year
- `sic1`: Top-level SIC
- `sic1_name`: Name of top-level SIC ("Agriculture", "Mining" and so on)
- `sic`: Four-digit SIC number according to the 1987 rules.
- `nb`: Our classification of patents as either "automation" or "rest" according to the Naive Bayes algorithm.
- `affil`: Two options ("sector of manufacture" and "industry of use")
- `weight`: Uses either no weights ("none") or weights patents by the number of their citations.
- `assignee`: Four options ("other", "foreigners", "governments" and "universities")
- `patents`: Number of patent (equivalents).

Be careful when you use this dataset, as some variables provide subsets to the dataset and some offer alternative datasets:
- `affil` and `weight` are options you can choose
- `nb` and `assignee` contain the values for subsets of patents. So if, for example, you want to know how many automation patents there are in some industry that are owned by any entity, then you need to sum across the `assignee` variable.

## 3. Commuting zone level dataset

Includes the number of patents that can be used in a US commuting zones.

- `cz`: Commuting zone
- `year`: Grant year
- `type`: Transformation. Either in absolute levels or transformed as described in paper.
- `assignee`: Group who is assigned patent, as described above. `all` also contains the the other categories `university and public research`, `foreign` and `government`.
- `weight`: Citation weights as described above.
- `autopats`: Automation patents
- `nonautopats`: All other patents, not described as automation patents.


# How to use

## Stata

Use the [maptile](https://michaelstepner.com/maptile/) program to create maps:

```stata
import delim data/czone_dataset.csv
keep if type == "level" & assignee == "all" & weight == "none"

maptile autopats if year==1976, geography(cz) conus nquantiles(4) /// 
	savegraph(figures\map_1976.png) replace legdecimals(0) resolution(0.5) /// 
	twopt(title(Automation patents: 1976))
```
